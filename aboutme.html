    <h1><strong><em>About Me</em></strong> - Jimmy T.</h1>
    <p>Hello to anyone that is interested in reading <strong>ABOUT ME!</strong></p>
    <p>There's definitely nothing special about me at all. As you can tell, my name is Jimmy Tran.
       I was born and raised in Chicago. My nationality is Vietnamese and I am bi-lingual with English 
       being my first language and Vietnamese as my second. I mainly only speak my native language with 
       my parents and english to my siblings and friends. I've practically lived in Chicago all my life. 
       To be honest, I've never even visited my home country of Vietnam. Although, I have been to other places/
       countries like Ontario, Vancouver, Toronto which are places in Canada. I've also been to Helsinki, 
       Finland in Europe. I have only been to these places because I have friends and relatives that stay 
       there.</p>
    <h2><strong>Hobbies</strong></h2>
    <p>I particularly don't have too many hobbies but the few that I do have are eating out at fancy 
       places (if you can even call that a hobby), throwing around a lacrosse ball (I use to play back 
       in high school but only throw/shoot around now), and playing a whole lot of games. Specifically 
       computer games because I don't own much consoles even though I grew up having almost all the older 
       generation consoles like the DreamCast, N64, Genesis, GameBoy, Playstation, and many more. I just 
       don't own many of the newer generation consoles except the Wii U, because I've always been a 
       Nintendo fan, which I rarely touch nowadays.</p>
    <p>Some of the games on the computer that I currently play are: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Black Desert Online</li>
      <li>League of Legends</li>
      <li>Overwatch</li>
      <li>Warcraft 3</li>
      <li>Path of Exile</li>
      <li>Super Smash Brothers: Melee (NetPlay)</li>
      <li>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This may or may not seem like a lot of games to play, but it's not like I play them all at once. 
       I like to toggle around each variety of game because each game isn't the same. Some are first 
       person shooters, some are real time strategy, and some are massively multiplayer onine role playing 
       game.</p>
    <p>I guess I might as well mention the music I like to listen to, seeing that listening to music is 
       most likely another hobby. I usually like any type of music that sounds good. To be more specific, 
       I like to listen to music from eletronic dance music, hip-hop, r and b, etc. Although, these wouldn't be 
       the only genres I would listen to. I would listen to anything from rap to reggaetone or something like 
       "The Beatles". I love music in general, but definitely not ALL music. I can NOT do screamos, heavy 
       metal, or anything that doesn't sound too pleasant.</p>
